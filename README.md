As a team of 8 students in ENES100, we were tasked with creating an Over-Terrain Vehicle (OTV)
to complete objectives, including reading the duty cycle of a PWM signal, detecting
the magnetism of a disk, and navigating through an obstacle course. While we did not
succeed in all of these objectives, we learned lessons about teamwork, communication,
and cooperation throughout the experience.

This page contains code to demonstrate all of the sensors we used on our OTV, as well as the full
code that ran on the robot when testing it on the actual mission.
